This is the website for statistics workshops.

Please, check the [set-up](setup.qmd) page for important set-up instructions, before the workshop.

This workshop assumes you  **do not** have prior knowledge of statistics.

I recommend the following resources:

- [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz) (online book).
- [Statistics for Linguists in R](https://www.routledge.com/Statistics-for-Linguists-An-Introduction-Using-R/Winter/p/book/9781138056091) (texbook).
