You explain everything very clearly and provide a lot of useful resources. Besides, you’ve answered all the questions that we might have of our own research very wisely. ¡Muchas gracias Joseph! Ha sido un auténtico placer (ojalá algún día entender la estadística de la misma manera en que tú lo haces)."

2022-12-02T13:47:24Z,5,8,7,"I really appreciate Joseph for not only explaining stats in a very clear and east mode but also for letting us know what the figures and numbers mean to lead a meaningful interpretation. 

Also, Joseph explained academic or technical terms by changing them into more dummy-friendly wordings all the time. It made me so confortable during the  whole class in that I'm kind of a person who does not interrupt the flow by keep asking trivial stuff...I really thank him so much in this sense too.","The class contents were perfect, it would be better if we could have had more time with Joseph though","I do hope I can see you again in one of your future lectures, conference or classes :)"
