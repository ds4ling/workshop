We will use lme4 to fit mixed effects models and sjPlot to summarize/visualize them. The remotes package allows us to install packages directly from github, like the ds4ling package specified in line 2. This package provides some useful helper functions we will use in our examples. It should take a few minutes to install the packages, depending on your system and configuration. If at any point you get asked about installing extra packages or software, please do so."
