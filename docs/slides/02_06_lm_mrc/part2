# Old assumptions revisited

### Model specification errors

#### Avoid excluding relevant variables

- Use Multiple Working Hypotheses

- This is how you safeguard against leaving out a variable that you might need 
later

- But don't put in everything but the kitchen sink...
--
you also must avoid including irrelevant variables

- Ideally you want to use plausible rival hypotheses

--

- You need to have some theory behind your reasoning

--

- Assuming you have done all of this, we need to figure out which predictors 
are relevant and which are not relevant

- This is not nearly as a big of a problem as having excluded a relevant 
variable

---

# How useful is the model output?

### Traditional t-test to determine if the b = 0

- Take b-weight, compute standard error
- Use SE<sub>b</sub> and the b-weight and construct a t-ratio:

#### $$t_b = (b/SE_b)$$

- Theoretically this informs us of whether b = 0 or not

--

### Problem

- The b-weights and the SE of the b-weight are both critically dependent 
on the model being correctly specified!
- If you made either kind of model specification error, the parameter estimates 
are invalid
  - The b-weights might have changed if you omitted a relevant variable
  - The SE of the b-weights will have changed (increased) if you included an 
  irrelevant variable

---
background-image: url(../../assets/img/frustracion.jpg)
background-position: 90% 50%

# How useful is the model output?

### Your t-tests might not be informative 

- If the model is not correctly specified then it is based  
on incorrect values of either b or SE<sub>b</sub> or both

--

- If you knew the model was correctly specified then you  
would have no need to use the t-tests in the first place

--

- You only need to use them if you're unsure whether the  
model is correctly specified

- So the only conditions in which the tests are useful are  
the conditions in which they may be invalid!

--

- But you only test this if you are questioning the  
specification of the model

### How do you deal with this?

# Nested model comparisons

### Hierarchical Partitioning of Variance

- Comparison of "hierarchically nested" multiple regression models

- Requires theoretical specification and causal ordering of predictors

--

### What is a nested model?

.content-box-blue[

A nested model is when one model is nested inside the other such that there is 
a more inclusive model that contains more parameters and a less inclusive model 
(restricted model) that contains just a subset of specific variables you would 
like to test

]

---

# Nested model comparisons

### What is a nested model?

- In nested model comparisons, you are testing whether those parameters not in 
the restricted model can be eliminated:
  - You want to see if those parameters not in the restricted models can be set 
  to 0
  - You want to see if these extra parameters are needed or if they can be 
  taken out

<p></p>

- Testing a more complicated model and then a less complicated one

---

# Nested model comparisons

### Comparing nested models

- You often cannot compare two different restricted models directly

<p></p>

- If the models do not overlap they cannot be directly compared:
  - So you must construct an inclusive model such that both restricted models 
  are nested within a common inclusive model
  - Then we can do the nested model comparisons
  - Run the alternative restricted models and test each against the same 
  inclusive model

  variable

- We are attempting the elimination of irrelevant variables with this procedure:
  - We cannot address omission of a relevant variable this way (or in any other 
  mathematical way because you cannot do math on variables that you didn’t 
  measure in first place `r emojifont::emoji("woman_facepalming")`)
  - This method corrects Type I Errors only

  it

  loss of explanatory power

<p></p>

- It is not a test of whether what you have included is relevant:
  - It’s not what’s left in the model that is being tested
  - It’s what’s not in the restrictive model that is being tested

- Your restricted model would be R<sup>2</sup> (y, x<sub>1</sub>)

eliminate the kurtosis variable from the model

the model

# Stop voicing example (cont.)

.pull-left[

- Suppose skewness and kurtosis can predict 40% of the variance in VOT

- If skewness alone can predict 38% of this, then:
  - The squared semipartial correlation of kurtosis is 40% - 38% = 2%
  - Which is less than our total error variance because 1 - 40% = 60%

- Then skewness does just fine on its own predicting VOT and we can eliminate 
kurtosis as a predictor
  - Provided the F-ratio for the semipartial of kurtosis is not statistically 
  significant
  - This also may depend on sample size

- On the other hand, if skewness only accounts for say 10% of the variance
  - Then 40% - 10% = 30%
  - Then kurtosis might still be important and we cannot eliminate it from 
  the model due to a statistically significant semipartial F-ratio

- You are testing to see if skewness is strong enough to account for VOT in 
coronal stops without considering kurtosis

- You want a non-significant semipartial F- ratio if you want to eliminate any 
variable

### Hierarchical tests of significance

### $$F_{(\color{red}{k_{I}}-\color{blue}{k_{R}}),(n - \color{red}{k_{I}} - 1)} = \frac{(\color{red}{R^2_{I}} - \color{blue}{R^2_{R}}) / (\color{red}{k_{I}} - \color{blue}{k_{R}})}{(1 - \color{red}{R^2_{I}}) / (n - \color{red}{k_{I}} - 1)}$$

- R<sup>2</sup> = Squared multiple correlation

- k = Model degrees of freedom (number of predictors)

- n = Total sample size

- .RUred[I] = .RUred[Inclusive Model] (Including All Predictors)

- .blue[R] = .blue[Restricted Model] (Excluding Some Predictors)

- (.RUred[R<sup>2</sup><sub>I</sub>] – .blue[R<sup>2</sup><sub>R</sub>]) = 
Squared Semipartial Correlation

---

# Nested model comparisons

- Results of hierarchical partitioning of variance and hierarchical tests of 
significance depend critically upon causal order specified among predictors:
  - There is no purely mathematical solution to this problem
  - Causal ordering of predictors must be specified by theory

- Comparisons of hierarchically nested models permit testing of alternative 
hypotheses generated by rival causal theories

- A "confound" is just an alternative hypothesis towards which one has a 
negative attitude

--

### What about likelihood ratio tests?

---

# Nested model comparisons

### Genetics example revisited

- You share 50% of genes with your Mom (M) and 50% with your Dad (D)

- But your parents don’t share that many genes

- M and D are generally not genetically correlated with each other, but you 
(the M\*D interaction) are correlated with both M and D

--

- So M and D are main (additive) effects and you are the M\*D (multiplicative) 
interaction

- You are now correlated with both main effects

- This causes *multicollinearity*

- M and D may then argue over this shared variance

- You have become a confound

---

# Nested model comparisons

### Dealing with multicollinearity

- To test for the statistical significance of the interaction effect, you use 
hierarchically nested model comparisons:
  - This is a the reasonable solution for the problem of multicollinearity
  - Interaction terms (nonadditivity) ALWAYS create multicollinearity

- If the main effect variables are already correlated, the multicollinearity is 
worse:
  - But you still get multicollinearity even if the component main effects are 
  not correlated

--

- The purely additive model (main effects only) is simpler than the 
multiplicative model (including the interaction):
  - So if the additive model can do it then go with it because it is 
  more parsimonious
  - Leave out (eliminate) the interaction effects first because they might be 
  too confusing

---

# Nested model comparisons

### Example: A multiple regression with three predictors

.center[
`y ~ a * b * c`
]

|                         |                   |
| :---------------------- | :---------------- |
| Main effects:           | a, b, and c       |
| Two way interactions:   | a:b, a:c, and b:c |
| Three way interactions: | a:b:c             |

<p></p>

- So which terms get causal priority in the hierarchical partitioning of 
variance?
--

- Main effects, then two way interactions, then three way interactions, etc.

--

### It is more parsimonious to use the main effects:

- Fewer dfs are used and it is a less complicated model
- Using a linear additive model is generally the most parsimonious way to go 
about it
- It is thought that any common variance should be given first to the main 
effects because they are conceptually more parsimonious

---

# Nested model comparisons

### Lack of parsimony

- If you use an interaction term (e.g., a*b), you are claiming that you need 
BOTH in order to have an effect
  - This is an extra substantive claim which needs to be supported 
  - It’s an **AND** statement not an .blue[OR] statement, so it’s a bit riskier

<p></p>

- Inclusive model contains all interactions that you wish to test:
  - Then you use restricted models to test each interaction separately

<p></p>

- You can generate a ridiculous amount of hypotheses with a small number of 
variables and this might really compromise your model parsimony:
  - You need a theoretical reason to include an interaction term

---

# Nested model comparisons

### Summarizing

- Problem: Multicollinearity

- Solution: Hierarchical partitioning of variance

- Make an inclusive model and do hierarchical partitioning of variance

- Determine which terms (lower order and higher order, additive and 
interactive), if any, can be eliminated

---

# Nested model comparisons

### Causal priority

- So which one gets causal priority?

<p></p>

- Main effects generally do:
  - But now two-way interactions and squared terms are just as complicated
  - So are three-way interactions and cubed terms, etc.

<p></p>

- There is no convention for deciding which comes first:
  - There is no mathematical solution to this problem
  - We need a theoretical solution

---

# Nested model comparisons

### Use principles of strong inference

- Only test plausible rival hypotheses

- Be careful and selective!

- Even with a small number of primitive component terms (main effects), once 
you examine all the possible interactions you will have a complex model

- You will exhaust your statistical power very quickly

---

# Nested model comparisons

### Doing it in R

- Fit all the relevant models

```{r, mod_comp1}
mod_full <- lm(mpg ~ wt + drat + wt:drat, data = mtcars) # inclusive model
mod_int  <- lm(mpg ~ wt + drat          , data = mtcars) # restricted model
mod_drat <- lm(mpg ~ wt                 , data = mtcars) # restricted model
mod_wt   <- lm(mpg ~ drat               , data = mtcars) # restricted model
mod_null <- lm(mpg ~ 1                  , data = mtcars) # null model
```

--

- Test higher order variables and main effects using nested model comparisons  
  - In R we do this with the .red[`anova()`] function
  - It is not an anova (for that we use the .red[`aov()`] function)
  - We include the restricted model and the inclusive model to test if removing 
  the variable from the inclusive model significantly changes the goodness of it
  - If it does, then we leave it in (it is important)
  - If it doesn't, then we can take it out (it is not important)

---

# Nested model comparisons

### Doing it in R

```{r, mod_comp2}
anova(mod_int, mod_full) # Test interaction effect
```

--

- There is a significant interaction of `wt` and `drat` (*F*(1) = 5.41, 
p < 0.03)

# Capitalizing on Chance

---

### Inflated R<sup>2</sup>

- Least squares estimation capitalizes on chance associations
- Including irrelevant variables increases R<sup>2</sup> non-significantly
- Sample R<sup>2</sup> is systematically overestimated, or inflated

--

### As k increases, there is more capitalization on chance 

- This is bad
- Every variable you measure has some error in it, and some of this error can 
be capitalized on by least squared estimation and this will boost our observed 
R<sup>2</sup>
- So sample R<sup>2</sup> deviates more from the true population R<sup>2</sup> 
as k increases

--

### As n increases, the overestimation of R<sup>2</sup> is less: 

- This is good
- The bigger the sample we have, the closer our observed R<sup>2</sup> will be 
to the real population R<sup>2</sup>
- When n equals infinity, then our sample R<sup>2</sup> would equal the real 
R<sup>2</sup>

### Taking repeated risks

Type I Error every 1 in 20 times

- But if you do it multiple times your chances of eventually making a Type I 
Error greatly increases

high

# Empirical selection of variables

### We should strive to create theoretically specified models that test a priori alternative hypotheses:

- In these models (in a perfect world), all hypotheses are carefully 
selected, plausible rival hypotheses

- Higher order variables are included when theoretically motivated

### We should be discouraged from testing atheoretical ones:

- If you do all possible comparisons, you weaken your statistical 
power and you get alpha slippage

- When you try to correct for the alpha slippage (by making a more stringent 
test-wise alpha) you run the risk of committing more Type II Errors

---

# Empirical selection of variables

- There are other techniques in multiple regression that are completely different in basic objectives  
i.e., empirical selection or exploratory regression techniques

- There are two reasons why we would use exploratory regression techniques that 
are not based on theory:

  - Reason 1: Some people are interested in prediction and not causation, and 
  predictions don’t require theory

  - Reason 2: There may be an honest lack of theory in the area you are 
  investigating

---

# Empirical selection of variables

### Reason 1: Some people are interested in prediction and not causation, and predictions don’t require theory

- For example, motorcycle ownership increases car insurance rates:
  - Causally, this makes no sense
  - But for predictive purposes, it does make sense

<p></p>

- Motorcycle owners may be riskier car drivers due to personality factors:
  - High testosterone 
  - Frontal lobe development?

---

# Empirical selection of variables

### Reason 2: There may be an honest lack of theory in the area you are investigating

- It might be an entirely new area of scientific investigation

- It might be the case that existing theory was found inadequate or 
insufficiently supported by the evidence

<p></p>

- However, some people still use exploratory techniques even when they have a 
theory that they could be testing 
  - experimenter degrees of freedom
  - p-hacking
  - fishing expeditions
  - pseudoscience

<p></p>

- This is unnecessary and wrong

---

# Empirical selection of variables

### How should we do it?

- First, we must design the study:
  - We need to sample a broad set of variables, and think as creatively and 
  diversely as you can about what to include
  - We need to go beyond the “usual suspects”
- Second, we need to specify the model:
  - How do we figure out which variables to include and which should be 
  excluded without a theory?
- Two elementary methods:
  - Backward Elimination
  - Forward Selection

---

# Empirical selection of variables

### Backward elimination

1. Include all your variables into a single simultaneous regression model:
  - Get b-weights, R<sup>2</sup>, etc.
  - Take a look at all the b-weights
2. Try to eliminate any irrelevant variables:
  - You are focusing on variables with the smallest effect sizes and the "least 
  significant" b-weights
  - Do this one step at time, because multicollinearity may be involved
  - Remember this is not theoretically-based and there are no a priori 
  hypotheses
3. Re-fit the model with the weakest variable eliminated
4. Compare new model to the original one and see if its better:
  - Look at the new R<sup>2</sup> and then compare the R<sup>2</sup> of the 
  model with that variable included with the model with that variable removed, 
  and see if the new model is statistically acceptable
5. If you could eliminate that variable, you now look at this model (not the 
original model) and see which is the next weakest variable
  - Try to eliminate this one, and do the same thing all over again

---

# Empirical selection of variables

### Backward elimination

- Keep doing this until when everything left is significant

- When removing something more results in a statistically significant sR2 F-ratio

- Then you have to put that last variable back in, and that’s your final model

- You are picking off the weakest variables until you can no longer validly eliminate anything else

---

# Empirical selection of variables

### Backward elimination - Problems

- In true backward elimination, once you eliminate something you can’t go back 
on that decision

- Due to Multicollinearity, one variable that was eliminated in an earlier step 
might now be significant in a new context, but you have no way to know this:

- Remember significance is often context dependent

- Variable A might have not been significant in step 2, but now that variables 
B, C, and D have been removed it might be significant

---

# Empirical selection of variables

### Forward selection

- Correlate all the predictors with the criterion variable (do bivariate 
correlations of all the predictors with the criterion):
  - Pick the one with the best bivariate correlation
  - Run the model with this correlation
- Now, you don't want to include your next largest bivariate correlation from 
the original correlations that you found:
  - Instead, you partial out variable 1 from all remaining variables
  - Then you take the one with the biggest sR<sup>2</sup> after variable 1 was 
  removed and run the next regression
- To get variable 3, you partial out variable 1 and 2 and look at the variable 
with the next biggest sR<sup>2</sup>, and then you put that one in

### Forward selection

- After each step, you take the difference in your R<sup>2</sup> values and 
test it for significance to see if the newly added variable adds a significant 
amount of variance to the previous model:
  - If you have already added variables 1 and 2, and now you want to add 
  variable 3 you need to compare the model with variables 1 and 2 with the 
  model with variables 1, 2, and 3
  - So you subtract the R<sup>2</sup> and do the semi-partial F-ratio
  - Just like an a priori hierarchical procedure!
- Do this until the most recently added variable no longer adds significance 
variance (sR<sup>2</sup>) to the model:
  - And then throw that variable back!
- Why not test the remaining ones?
  - Because you were testing the ones with the largest sR<sup>2</sup>, so any 
  remaining variables will have lower sR<sup>2</sup> and will therefore not add 
  any more significant variance to the model than your last tested variable

### Forward selection - Problems

Similar to Backward Elimination:

- As you put things in there is no way for you to go back and change variables 
that you already added

- So there is no way of going back and rethinking what you have already done

- Even though variable 1 may have been good in the original context, but now 
that other variables have been added, it might not make so much sense anymore

- So you can end up in two completely different places using the same data when 
you use forward selection and backward elimination

# Empirical selection of variables

### Stepwise regression

- Stepwise Regression is the most popular procedure for exploratory regression:
  - It is a combination of forward selection and backward elimination
  - Not the same as hierarchical partitioning of variance!
- Basically, you take one step forward, one step back, one step forward, etc.:
  - Start with forward selection, then do backward elimination
  - Until both of the procedures fail and you can’t add anything profitably and 
  you can’t lose anything profitably
- By combining the two procedures, you get to add something, but then you 
follow the addition immediately with a backward elimination to see if you can 
eliminate something else:
  - Which you couldn’t do previously with forward selection
  - The backward elimination looks at everything, so you can eliminate anything 
  and anytime as long as you don’t lose a significant amount of variance
  - So you can eliminate variable 1 in step 8

### Benefits of using exploratory regression techniques:

- You get to proceed in spite of lack of theoretical guidance

- Produce hypotheses/theory building for future research

### Major problems involved:

- No a priori theory involved, so the procedure is totally mindless

- You are testing a very large number of variables and you are running a HUGE 
risk of committing Type I Errors due to massive capitalization on chance

- In fact, you might end up with nothing but Type I Errors!

# Reporting

- The main purpose is to explain what you did in a manner that is understandable 
and reproducible
- You should report: 

1. General description: 
  - The model you used to fit your data
  - The variables included (criterion, predictors)
  - Transformations (if applicable)
  - Tests for model assumptions
  - How you assessed main effects and interactions
  - Alpha
2. Results
  - Model fit
  - Main effects (usually model comparisons)
  - Interactions (usually model comparisons)
  - Interpretations (directionality, b-weights, SE, CI, p-values)
